**Core Mechanic
	Send out signals
	Change sattilite altitude
	Time-->score
	Survive

**Extra mechanics
	Time/Score will charge special ability. 
		Ability will add a layer in orbit. Giving more space to work with. In addition this function 
		will allow you to 
		
		Tap enemie ships to shoot them. Buils up charges to shoot.

**High Level Concept
	Je moet zoveel mogelijk ruimteschepen de lucht in sturen, om contact te maken met aliens.
		
**Rewards
	Bringing down satilites increes score
	Every satilite in orbit incresases score multiplier
	Building reward while having 'amount' of satilites active.
	killing enemy with satalite gives more bonus points because you offer score resources to safe yourself. basicly.

**Punishment
	Bringing down wrong satilite can have two effects
		-Creating space debree wich will hinder you for a certain amount of time.
		-Crashing down to earth and having the chance to hitting your towers wich will the result in either 
		malfunction(having reversed effect) or disabling the tower. 
		
		!!Feedback for player is very impoortant here!!
		

**Progression
	Progression is driven by time. The longer you stay alive the more progress you make. Meaning the game
	will get harder as you stay alive longer. 

	Progression will introduce:
		new size and sort of satilites
		extra mechanics
		

**Emergence
	*Mechanics: Modify to create emergent interactions		
		-mechanics need to effect eachother correctly and cause bugs

	*Dynamics: Combining mechanics.
		"Note: Make sure not to combine to many mechanic to prevent bugs
	
	*Aestectics: increasing playfield

	*Player feedback(feedback loops)
		-Sound
			spawning satilite/crashing/shooting lasers/sending signals/powerupbar rdy/use powerup/
			
		-Visual effects
			use powerup/defect-malfunctioned towers/
	

**Satilites
	Satilites that crash into eachother leave behind debree in space on multiple lanes

	Satilite size: big ones cover more lanes/layers.
		When big satilites crash debree will cover more lanes.
		
	Satilites can crash(%-based(maybe)) 
		crashed satilites can disrupt signals from towers. 
		crashed satilites can disable towers for periodic time.
		Size of the satility can influence this effect.
		If collision happens during a crash the hit satilite will fall aswel. (can cause chain reactions)
		
	A kind of satilite that attacks the players towers
		these satilites are ment to be destroyed

**Extras:
	Implementation of missions/achievements. 
		Achievements should speak for itself. Its a personal award for doing something. FOr example
		having 5 satilites in the air.

		Mission can be objectives generated randomly that can grand bonus points to your score
			-destroy amount of ships
			-Add orbit layer
			-Serive for duration while having x amount of satilites active etc
