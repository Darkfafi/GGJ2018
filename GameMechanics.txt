**Satilites
	Satilites that crash into eachother leave behind debree in space on multiple lanes

	Satilite size: big ones cover more lanes/layers.
		When big satilites crash debree will cover more lanes.
		
	Satilites can crash(%-based(maybe)) 
		crashed satilites can disrupt signals from towers. 
		crashed satilites can disable towers for periodic time.
		Size of the satility can influence this effect.
		If collision happens during a crash the hit satilite will fall aswel. (can cause chain reactions)
		
	A kind of satilite that attacks the players towers
		these satilites are ment to be destroyed
